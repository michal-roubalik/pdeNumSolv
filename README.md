# Lambda-Nabla PDE Num Solver

This is implementation of numerical solver of Partial Differential Equations:
- Parabolic (e.g. Diffusion)
- Hyperbolic (e.g. Transport)
- Elliptic (e.g. Waves)

Input dada are taken from .xlsx file, these inclue:
- Equation type
- Solution scheme
- Time dependency, horizon and granularity
- Space Granularity

## Currently implemented
- Static Parabolic Equation with Dirichlet and Neumann Boundary Conditions
